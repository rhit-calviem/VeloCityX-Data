## Trends and Results 
1. Users Most Likely to Purchase Virtual Merchandise:

Cluster 0 users are the most likely to purchase virtual merchandise, with an average of 3.8 purchases per user. These users are highly engaged, completing the most challenges, spending significant time on "Live 360," and having high predictive accuracy. Their high overall participation suggests that engagement across multiple activities correlates strongly with purchases.  
Cluster 2 and Cluster 1 have much lower average purchases (2.0 and 2.4, respectively). Users in these clusters tend to focus more on chat activity and sponsorship interactions, indicating less interest in buying virtual goods.

2. Correlation Between User Activities and Merchandise Purchases:

Fan Challenges: There is a positive correlation (0.16) between the number of fan challenges completed and merchandise purchases, meaning that users who participate in challenges are more likely to make purchases. This is supported by Cluster 0â€™s higher challenge completion rate and purchase activity.  
Time on Live 360: Although users spending more time on Live 360 coverage have slightly lower correlations with merchandise purchases, it's still a valuable engagement metric. Users who are more engaged with the Live 360 feature are exposed to more interactive elements of the app, possibly driving them towards making purchases.  
Chat Activity: There is a small negative correlation (-0.04) between chat activity and merchandise purchases, suggesting that users who spend more time in real-time chats (like those in Cluster 2) may not be as inclined to buy merchandise.

3. Sponsorship Interactions and Merchandise Purchases:

The correlation between sponsorship interactions (ad clicks) and merchandise purchases is positive but weak (0.07). However, certain clusters exhibit stronger links. For example, Cluster 2, which is highly engaged with sponsorships (14.2 ad clicks on average), purchases fewer virtual goods than Cluster 0. This suggests that users highly focused on sponsorships may not overlap much with merchandise purchasers.


## Conclusions:
There are highly engaged users in multiple activities, such as completing fan challenges, are these are the most likely to purchase virtual merchandise (Cluster 0).  
Users who primarily focus on real-time chat or sponsorship interactions (Cluster 2) are less likely to purchase.  
Activities like fan challenges and Live 360 participation offer better opportunities to target users with merchandise promotions, while chat-heavy users might require a different strategy (e.g., using challenges to entice them towards purchases).


## Proposed Challenge

### Challenge Name: 
"Prediction Power-Up"
### Details: 
A real-time challenge that encourages users to make race predictions while engaging in the Live 360 feature. Higher accuracy in predictions earns them virtual coins, which can be redeemed for digital merchandise. Chat engagement during the race unlocks bonus coins, and sponsorship interactions give users more prediction power (i.e., more chances to adjust their predictions).
### Target Audience: 
Primarily Cluster 2, due to their high chat activity and sponsorship interactions.
### Predicted Outcomes:
Increased Merchandise Sales by integrating rewards with merchandise, encouraging in-app purchases.  
Higher Sponsorship Engagement as ads are tied to gameplay benefits, boosting interaction.  
Engagement Growth because it leverages high chat activity, especially for Cluster 2, to increase fan participation.
